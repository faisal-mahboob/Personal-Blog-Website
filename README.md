# Personal-Blog-Website
1st Front End Developer Project

In this Projecct I used HTML and CSS to make the blog web page. CSS was used a lot more than HTML. This was my first project in the Front Web Development Nanodegree program. I used Visual Studio Code to write and debugg the code. The home page has blog posts , of which travel blog is accessible while the meme post is unaccessible. I enjoyed making the website , i hope you could like some of it as well, I am always open to making changes. 

You can install Visual Studip Code here: https://code.visualstudio.com/

In this project there is an index.html file, a CSS Main (with home page CSS), CSS Blog1 (with travel blog post CSS), Images and Video folder.

There is no copyrights here, you may fork the code and change anything as you like.
